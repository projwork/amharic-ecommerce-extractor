## Named Entity Recognition (NER) Labeling

### CoNLL Format Implementation

Following international standards, we implemented BIO (Beginning-Inside-Outside) tagging for three critical entity types using our custom AmharicCoNLLLabeler system:

#### Entity Recognition Infrastructure

- **Price Patterns:** 6 regex patterns for multilingual price detection
- **Processing Architecture:** Modular system with confidence-based entity resolution

#### Entity Categories and Coverage

1. **Products (B-PRODUCT/I-PRODUCT):** 15 entities identified

   - Electronics: ስልክ (phone), iPhone, laptop, ኮምፒዩተር (computer)
   - Clothing: ቲሸርት (t-shirt), ልብስ (clothes), ጫማ (shoes)
   - Furniture: እቃዎች (furniture), ወንበር (chair)
   - Construction: cement, steel, tiles
